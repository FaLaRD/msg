          | People think focus means saying yes to the thing you&rsquo;ve got to focus on. But that&rsquo;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I&rsquo;m actually as proud of the things we haven&rsquo;t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
